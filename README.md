## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

<br>

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

<br>

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

<br>

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

<br>

## Running automated tests

`npx cypress run` – Non-interactive test runner. Runs the tests in a “headless” browser. This means the browser window is not visible.

`npx cypress open` – Interactive test runner. Opens a window where you can select which tests to run and which browser to use. The browser window is visible and it remains visible after completion.
